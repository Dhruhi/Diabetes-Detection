# Diabetes-Detection
A Machine Learning model to detect diabetes in female using various parameters. The model is made using Support Vector Machine(SVM) Classifier algorithm.

8 features are considered in order to give the label as Diabetic(1) or Non diabetic(0), those features are Pregnancies, Glucose, BloodPressure,	SkinThickness,	Insulin,	BMI,	DiabetesPedigreeFunction and	Age.
I have used Support vector machine algorithm for this classification.
The accuracy of the training data and test data came out as 78.66% and 77.27% respectively.
